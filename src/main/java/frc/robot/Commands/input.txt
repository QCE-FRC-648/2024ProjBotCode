Theresa's Input: 

TO DO: 
- Make more commands in here and split into folders 
    Ex. Have a flywheel command folder and put commands for the flywheel in the flywheel folder (This was done in this repo already)
    - Make folders for intake commands, climber commands, drive commands, etc. 
- Go through and understand the changes I added in to make Path Planner work
